    <!-- About Me
    I'm hungry to learn and improve. There is always something new to see, and something I can better myself at.

    I drive projects to completion with the support of my teams, and the approval of my clients and customers.

    I ensure communication happens. I shoot for an email inbox 0, drive technical calls, and initiate in-person
    meetings.

    I write documentation, develop tools, do quality assurance, move boxes, and do what needs to be done to get the job
    DONE.

    Education / Background
    I graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2016 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science.

    I'm a US Citizen, currently located in Southern California (Irvine).

    My Mission
    I seek to learn, contribute, and be part of an engineering team to build large, scalable systems.

    With my technical background, project management experience, I aspire to develop great products.

    Current Work
    I'm a Sales Engineer at ID TECH Products. I work with our customers and partners to implement secure payment
    solutions in a timely manner.

    I provide technical documentation, drive product improvements, write / review code, and collaborate with customer
    engineering teams. -->
